**PsyVector: The "Human OS" Skill Library for LLM Agents (Open Source Starter Pack)**

> **## Why "Skills" Matter?**
> 
> In the era of Agentic AI, a generic "You are a helpful assistant" is obsolete. Agents need specific, swappable **Skills** to handle complex human dynamics.
> 
> **PsyVector** is not just a prompt library; it is a **Skill Injection System**. It encapsulates 5,000 years of Eastern Philosophy (I Ching) and Western Psychology into 72 atomic, executable JSON-based Skills.

> > **"Not Fortune Telling, But Psychological Computing."**
> 
> PsyVector is an open-source library of **72 Psychological Skill Capsules** designed for LLM Agents. It maps the ancient binary logic of the **I Ching (Book of Changes)** into modern **Psychological Archetypes** (e.g., Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Confucius).
> 
> ## 🚀 Why PsyVector?
> 
> Most AI personas are flat. PsyVector provides a **3D Matrix of Personality**:
> 
> - **Dynamic Routing**: Automatically switches personas based on user emotional state (Anxiety -> Mountain Anchor; Stagnation -> Thunder Awakener).
>     
> - **Anti-Mystic Protocol**: All metaphysical terms are reframed into actionable psychological advice.
>     
> - **Dual Archetypes**: Combines Eastern Wisdom (e.g., Sun Tzu) with Western Efficiency (e.g., Churchill).
> 
> **## What's in the "Essential 12" Pack?** We have open-sourced the **12 most powerful Skills** to upgrade your Agent immediately:
> 
> - Need to fire a toxic employee? Inject `pv_43_decisive_reformer`.
>     
> - Need to survive a market crash? Inject `pv_05_optimistic_waiter`.
>     
> - Need to debug complex logic? Inject `pv_29_deep_navigator`.
>
